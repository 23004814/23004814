                <h3>Academic Background</h3>
                <p>
                  I completed high school in 2022 at Kalahari High School, where my major subject was Computer Applications Technology (CAT), focusing on HTML and CSS.
In 2023, I began my journey in Computer Science through a Foundation program, where I studied Foundation Information Technology (FIT).
Later that year, during my first year of university, I was introduced to programming with Java.
Now, in my second year, I am currently learning C++ as I continue to build my skills in computer science and work towards a career in data analytics.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                 My main goal is to become a professional data analyst who can turn raw data into meaningful insights that support smart decision-making. I’m currently building a strong foundation in computer science, and each year I aim to grow both my technical and analytical skills. Starting with CAT in high school, where I was introduced to HTML and CSS, I’ve developed a strong interest in how technology and data work together.

Through my foundation year, I gained a better understanding of Information Technology, and in my first year, I started programming with Java, which helped me think more logically and improve my problem-solving skills. Now, in my second year, I’m learning C++ and focusing more on practical and technical skills that will be useful in the data analytics field.

In the future, I plan to learn tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization software, and to work on real-world projects that will prepare me for the workplace. My long-term vision is to contribute to organizations by helping them make data-driven decisions and to keep learning as technology evolves.
